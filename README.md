# Python Project for Data Science – IBM Coursera
## Overview
This repository contains my final assignment for the Python Project for Data Science course by IBM on Coursera.

The project demonstrates a Data Scientist / Data Analyst workflow, including:

- Data collection and web scraping
- Data analysis and visualization
- Dashboard creation using Python libraries

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world Data Science scenario.

### Key tasks included:

- Python Programming & Data Analysis
- Applied Python fundamentals, data structures, and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly
- Data Collection & Web Scraping
- Extracted financial data from online sources using Beautiful Soup
- Dashboard Creation
- Built interactive visualizations and dashboards in Jupyter Notebook

### Skills Gained

- Python Programming
- Data Analysis & Manipulation
- Web Scraping
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & Matplotlib
- Plotly Dashboards
- Data Processing & Visualization
